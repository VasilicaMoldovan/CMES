Problem: Bread machine: A bread machine has several components, among which: the water sensor, the flour sensor and the entire
machine controller. All those three colaborate in order to make the machine work properly.
Actors: Water Sensor, Flour Sensor, Machine Controller
Signals:
	1. The Water Sensor detects water and lets the machine's controller know that.
	2. The Flour Sensor detects flour(and other powder ingredients) and lets the machine's controller know that.
	3. When the machine's controller knows that it has both flour and water, it can start making the bread. After the bread
	is done, the values of the water and flour sensors are reset.
